Compared to coarser satellite fire data, the spatially-refined Landsat-8 detections enable new landscape-scale analyses and applications, including assimilation into weather-fire models and tactical fire management.\n\nEstimation of land surface temperature of dindigul district using Landsat 8 data (Rajeshwari A, 2014)\nThis article estimates land surface temperature (LST) for Dindigul district in Tamil Nadu, India using Landsat 8 satellite data. The paper effectively uses Landsat 8 data and the SW algorithm to map LST variations across Dindigul district, relating it to factors like land cover and elevation. The 30m resolution allows detailed LST analysis for climate and land studies."

And it emphasizes the suitability and accuracy of Landsat-8 data for various applications and its potential for monitoring environmental and natural resource-related variables.\n\nLand cover classification using Landsat 8 operational land imager data in Beijing, China (Jia et al., 2014)\nThe article discusses the use of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for land cover classification in Beijing, China. It compares the data quality of OLI and Landsat 7 ETM+ data using texture features and evaluates the performance of OLI data for land cover classification. The study found that OLI data had satisfactory performance, with overall classification accuracy exceeding 90%. It provides valuable insights into the use of OLI data for land cover classification."
