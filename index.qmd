## Introduction to Landsat 8 {.smaller}

-   Landsat 8 launched on February 11, 2013
-   It is formerly known as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), and it was developed as a collaboration between NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
-   It is used for moderate-resolution optical remote sensing for land, coastal areas and shallow waters
-   It provides continuity with the more than 40-year long Landsat land imaging data set

## Instruments {.smaller}

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
The Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS):

-   OLI collects data for visible, near infrared, and short wave infrared spectral bands as well as a panchromatic band
-   TIRS collects data for two more narrow spectral bands in the thermal region

Spatial resolution: 30 meters (visible, NIR, SWIR); 100 meters (thermal); 15 meters (panchromatic).

## Value of different bands {.smaller}

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   Band 1 senses deep blues and violets. It is used for imaging shallow water, and tracking fine particles like dust and smoke
-   Bands 2, 3, and 4 are visible blue, green, and red
-   Band 5 measures the near infrared, or NIR. It is especially important for ecology because healthy plants reflect it
-   Bands 6 and 7 cover different slices of the shortwave infrared, or SWIR. They are particularly useful for telling wet earth from dry earth, and for geology

## Mission target {.smaller}

#### Landsat 8 is part of the larger Landsat program

Since 1972, Landsat satellites have continuously acquired space-based images of the Earth's land surface.

## Research using Landsat 8 data {.smaller}

#### Active fire detection using Landsat-8/OLI data [@Schroeder2016]

The researchers created a new way to find fires using pictures from the Landsat-8 satellite, which takes photos using special light channels that can see fires. But the algorithm may not work as well in all situations because it sometimes gets confused by bright surfaces or when the fire is very small, which can make it miss some fires.

#### Estimation of land surface temperature of dindigul district using Landsat 8 data [@RajeshwariA2014]

The paper effectively uses Landsat 8 data and the SW algorithm to map LST variations across Dindigul district, relating it to factors like land cover and elevation. The 30m resolution allows detailed LST analysis for climate and land studies. However, this study focuses only on Dindigul District, so the findings may not be applicable to other regions with different climates and geographical features.

## Research using Landsat 8 data {.smaller}

#### Applications of Landsat-8 data: A survey [@Ridwan2018]

The article is a survey of the applications of Landsat-8 data in fields such as agriculture, forestry, land use, geology, hydrology, coastal resources, and environmental monitoring. But it might not include detailed technical challenges or the specific limitations of Landsat data, such as resolution constraints or cloud cover issues, which are important for beginners to understand.

#### Land cover classification using Landsat 8 operational land imager data in Beijing, China [@Jia2014]

The article discusses the use of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for land cover classification in Beijing, China. It compares the data quality of OLI and Landsat 7 ETM+ data using texture features and evaluates the performance of OLI data for land cover classification. Texture features like homogeneity and contrast were used to assess data quality, but other important image quality factors might not have been considered. Moreover, the land cover classification was limited to six classes, which may not capture the full complexity of land cover types in the study area.

## Reflection {.smaller}

-   Landsat 8 was a satellite launched by NASA, as part of the Landsat program. Landsat 8 carries the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS)

-   Landsat 8 data can be used in environmental monitoring, agricultural monitoring, water resource management, etc.

-   Landsat data is freely available to the public, following a long-standing tradition of the Landsat program's open data policy. This has encouraged widespread use and application of the data in various fields.

## Reflection {.smaller}

-   Landsat 8 enables the creation of time series data, allowing researchers to analyze changes over time. This is valuable for studying long-term trends and understanding the dynamics of Earth's surface.

-   Future work and applications of Landsat 8:

    <p>

    Change monitoring: monitoring and understanding the impact of climate change on the earth's surface

    <p>

    Disaster response: assessing and responding to natural disasters such as floods, wildfires and earthquakes

    <p>

    Urban planning: the high-resolution imagery supports urban planners in monitoring and managing urban growth and infrastructure development
