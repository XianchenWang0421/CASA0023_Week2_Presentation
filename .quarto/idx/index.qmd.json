It compares the data quality of OLI and Landsat 7 ETM+ data using texture features and evaluates the performance of OLI data for land cover classification. Texture features like homogeneity and contrast were used to assess data quality, but other important image quality factors might not have been considered. Moreover, the land cover classification was limited to six classes, which may not capture the full complexity of land cover types in the study area.\n\n## Reflection {.smaller}\n\n-   Landsat 8 was a satellite launched by NASA, as part of the Landsat program.
